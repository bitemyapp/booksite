    <h1>Getting Haskell installed</h1>
    <p>
      You'll need to get Haskell installed before you can do anything. One of the authors has written a guide which includes <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell#installing-haskell">install instructions</a>. Instructions for <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell/blob/master/install.md#109">Mac</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell/blob/master/install.md#windows">Windows</a> users are provided as well.

      </li>
      <li>
        We <a href=""></a>nd some of our readers that use OS X have tested <a href="http://haskellformac.com/">Haskell for Mac</a> and found it exceptional as a combined text editor and workspace for learning Haskell.
