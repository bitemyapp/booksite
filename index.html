  <h4>Update! - 2015-04-09</h4>

  <p>
    A lot has happened since I started writing this book. One of my students, Julie Moronuki, started editing it and testing it and has now become a full coauthor of the book. She's helping ensure that the concepts are explained in a clear and approachable way. Working together also means the content is coming together faster than it was when I was working alone.

  <h3>I am writing this book because I had a hard time learning Haskell.</h3>

  <p>
    It doesn't have to be that way. I've spent the last couple years actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way, I started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques in Haskell that eventually turned into <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell" target="_blank">my guide for learning haskell</a>. That experience led me to work on this book.
  </p>

  <p>
If you are new to programming entirely, Haskell is a great first language. You may have noticed the trend of "Functional Programming in [Imperative Language]" books and tutorials and learning Haskell gets right to the heart of what functional programming is. Languages such as Java are gradually adopting functional concepts, but most such languages were not designed to be functional languages, after all. We would not encourage you to learn Haskell as an <i>only</i> language, but because Haskell is a pure functional language, it is a fertile environment for mastering functional programming techniques. That way of thinking and problem solving is useful, no matter what other languages you might know or learn.
  </p>

  <p>
    Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite. I'm now able to tackle problems that I couldn't have tackled when I was primarily a Clojure, Common Lisp, or Python user. Haskell is difficult to teach effectively.
