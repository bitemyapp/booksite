<p>(It's a book)</p>

<h3>I am writing this book because I had a hard time learning Haskell</h3>

<p>
  It doesn't have to be that way. I've spent the last year actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way I started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques in Haskell that eventually turned into <a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell">my guide for learning haskell</a>.
</p>

<p>
  When I first started out, I was bad at teaching and barely understood what I was teaching. If I had written a book then, it'd have been terrible. I'm still learning how to teach Haskell better by working with people locally in Austin, Texas as well as online in the <a href="https://twitter.com/bitemyapp/status/463119899640868865">IRC channel I made for beginners to get help with learning Haskell</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite, I'm now able to tackle problems that I couldn't have tackled when I was primarily a Clojure, Common Lisp, or Python user. Haskell is difficult to teach <em>effectively</em>. This is partly because programmers as a community don't have a lot of experience teaching languages like Haskell.
</p>

<p>
  I've gotten to a point where between the tutorials I give in person, the open source work I do for Haskell, the side projects I work on, and having a day job isn't going to scale. There are more out there that would benefit greatly from learning Haskell than I or even the other people that help me in the IRC channel can teach. This book is my effort to convert what I've learned about what actually <em>works</em> for teaching and learning Haskell into something everybody can use while I'm <a href="http://i.imgur.com/JdkEjdr.jpg">napping with my dog</a>.
</p>

<p>
  My goal for the book is to cover the basics of Haskell as well as some of the later sticking points people often have trouble with. This is typically things like Functor, Applicative, Monad, and Monad transformers. I am also covering things like how IO works and how to reason about it and practicalities like what data structures are recommended for approaching different problems in Haskell.
