  <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Will there be a print version?</li>
    <p>
      Early access is being offered with people that want to help the book succeed
      without resorting to a gimmicky crowdfunding campaign. Since we plan
      to iterate on the book quickly it doesn't make sense to make print versions
      in media res. We are still trying to figure out an affordable printer that
      will satisfy our typographic and general quality expectations. Testing printers
      will be an expensive and time-consuming process and cannot happen until after
      the book is done. We do have our early access buyers in mind and will
      offer them discount codes for the print book when it is available if the publisher/printer allows it.
    </p>

    <li>Will there be an epub version?</li>
    <p>
      During the early access period we're going to be focused exclusively on the book
      rendered into PDF from our LaTeX. It's something we'll consider when the book is
      fully edited and ready for final publication, but our experiences getting
      <a href="http://pandoc.org/">pandoc</a> to understand our LaTeX haven't been
      successful so far because we're using custom commands, environments, and libraries.
      We'd definitely like a non-PDF ebook option that works widely and preserves the
      attention that has been paid to text layout.
    </p>

    <li>Why is the book's price &dollar;59?</li>
    <p>
      The book will be fairly long and relatively comprehensive in depth. You should
      expect a book that will take somebody from little to no programming background
      to having the understanding required to learn how industrial Haskell code works.
      We're expecting the final release to be over 900 pages of moderate density with
      letter pages. To see the scope of the book, check out <a href="/progress.html">
        our page on completed, upcoming, and planned chapters</a>. We're taking care
      in testing the material. We're not just writing stuff and shipping it after a
      cursory review from an editor.
    </p>

    <li>Why isn't there a chapter on web apps?</li>
    <p>

      The long and short of it is that we'd rather equip you to learn
      <em>anything you want</em> rather than teach you a particular library or framework.

      <p>
        What do I do if I can't build something?
        If you get an error like the following on Mac OS X:
      </p>
    <pre>
&#36; cabal build 
Building hello-haskell-0.1.0.0... 
Preprocessing executable 'hello-haskell' for hello-haskell-0.1.0.0... 
Linking dist/build/hello-haskell/hello-haskell ... 
couldn't understand kern.osversion `14.5.0' 
couldn't understand kern.osversion `14.5.0' 
ld: -rpath can only be used when targeting Mac OS X 10.5 or later 
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
    </pre>
    <p>
    Then you have a very old version of gcc, probably also of XCode. Uninstall whatever you currently have and reinstall a recent version of XCode. Alternately, you may be able to get a friendly version of GHC via <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
       However, if you aren't running Mac OS X and didn't get an error like the above, we <em>strongly</em> recommend using <a href="http://haskellstack.org">Stack</a> to use GHC, GHCi, and build your packages. We've made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRonIB8ZStw">a Youtube tutorial video for learning to use Stack</a>.
