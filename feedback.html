        <p>
          Despite it still being in development with many expansions to come, my experience with the current 800 pages of Haskell Programming has quelled any skepticism I had about its thoroughness or potential use to someone who had already spent two very devoted months studying Haskell. Having read books, blogs, and participated in Haskell's IRC channels during all of that period, thus covering most of the topics that are in the book, I felt like this would end up being more of the same: something that's useful (retreading over similar ground genuinely builds skill and understanding), but perhaps not an optimal use of my time (there are plenty of resources that already exist with which a person can do that, and I felt most suited to 'intermediate' resources).
          </p>
        <p>
Yet, Haskell Programming is so damn comprehensive, and so well structured, that it provided me with something that no other resource has been able to: an assurance that once I make it through a chapter, I will have learned the most critical things about its topic, and that anything which demands further elaboration ought to (and will be) addressed later on where it can be more deeply understood. So far the book has been very thorough about addressing each topic in as much depth as is sensible. I was tempted to skip the earlier chapters, but I'm very glad I didn't, and that the book clearly expresses why doing so is a bad idea in its introduction. Though it is targeted towards beginners, it ramps up at every chance it gets; it just doesn't want to make you lift weights before having you stretch. It is neither simple nor inaccessible, which is about perfect for learning.

Here's a short list of what I learned in those chapters that seemed like old news to me: I never really learned much about the Lambda Calculus, nor realized how much it explains how Haskell actually evaluates functions. I thought I'd understood Lists, but I'd never even heard the term "weak-head normal form". I supposed I was good at folds, but didn't realize that I could be great at them if my mental image of how they worked was enhanced. I figured I knew what data types were, but didn't have a deep intuition for the relationship between a type constructor and kinds, and a data constructor and algebra; I had no idea that learning why the hell | meant the data was a 'sum type' how having two or more arguments made it a 'product type' would actually be useful for reasons other that not impressing people with your boring knowledge (turns out they help you reason about code complexity and make smarter decisions with your data structures). I finally understand why a newtype is useful for reasons other than performance. I realized just how conceptually similar a Monoid + Functor and an Applicative Functor are.
        </p>

          Haskell Programming has thus put an end to the always-trying-to-figure-out-which-resource-is-best optimizing attitude that drove me from resource to resource in search of an understanding that usually takes more time and focus than most of them offer. Haskell has a sizable ecosystem, but it's really more for people who are 'intermediate' and above, and it turns out that intermediate Haskell knowledge is quite the tall order. Thankfully, this book's express goal is to take us there. Yes, you can learn Haskell without Haskell Programming, but with it you'll have one of the best inanimate companions you could hope for in that journey. It promises depth, and it really does offer it. It promises comprehensiveness, and I direct your attention to the current page count and pending additions. It promises clarity, and I promise you it has it. I also promise you that you won't learn Haskell more quickly any other way right now. If you're new to the language, have studied it for a couple of months, or basically are anyone who can't comfortably read through a library on Hackage right now, you'd probably love this book. Otherwise, you should probably read it anyways as a lesson on pedagogy.

          Oh boy, everything is a fold! I just got to the fold chapter in your book, and it hit me like a brick a couple pages in that pretty much everything we've seen up to now can be implemented with a fold. Not that I hadn't seen the idea before, but just realized how powerful of an idea it is :)

              This is a book that will teach how to learn. It dives in and out and back in again; so you don't miss anything. And it’s so painless and complete that you won’t appreciate how much you’ve learned until you have a chance to reflect. This is a ‘learners text’, it’s super-well thought out with tons of exercises that keep you moving along in your complete journey to becoming a competent Haskeller. I’ve read a few Haskell books, and with this one, I didn’t get bored once. I even took it on my vacation; I couldn’t put it down. Buy it, you won’t be disappointed!

              I want to thank you for your <em>great</em> help. After munging through the last chapters 5-7 you released, i begin to understand the way Haskell of thinking & coding. I even dare to read through haskell.org stuff without feeling like an idiot. Cannot await the next stage on this trip!
              <br><br>
              Thanks again.

              This haskell book explains complicated ideas in the most effective and simplest way I have ever seen in any programming book. If you can only read one Haskell book then read this Haskell book and you will not be disappointed.
