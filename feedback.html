Oh boy, everything is a fold! I just got to the fold chapter in your book, and it hit me like a brick a couple pages in that pretty much everything we've seen up to now can be implemented with a fold. Not that I hadn't seen the idea before, but just realized how powerful of an idea it is :)

This haskell book explains complicated ideas in the most effective and simplest way I have ever seen in any programming book. If you can only read one Haskell book then read this Haskell book and you will not be disappointed.

I want to thank you for your <em>great</em> help. After munging through the last chapters 5-7 you released, i begin to understand the way Haskell of thinking & coding. I even dare to read through haskell.org stuff without feeling like an idiot. Cannot await the next stage on this trip!

Thanks again.
