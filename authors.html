<p>
Chris has been programming for over 15 years, 8 of them professionally. He worked primarily in Common Lisp, Clojure, and Python. Chris became interested in Haskell about 6 years ago. Haskell is not a difficult language to use. Quite the opposite. Chris is now able to tackle problems in his day job and in side projects couldn't have been tackled without Haskell. Haskell is difficult to teach effectively, but doesn't have to be difficult to learn. Ineffective method and material has made it unnecessarily hard for many people to learn.
</p>

<p>
Chris has spent the last two years actively teaching Haskell online and in person. Along the way, he started keeping notes on exercises and methods of teaching specific concepts and techniques that worked. Those notes eventually turned into my guide for learning Haskell. Chris is still learning how to teach Haskell better by working with people locally in Austin, Texas, as well as online.

  <h3>Julie Moronuki</h3>

  <p>
Julie has a BA in philosophy and linguistics and an MA in linguistics ...and nothing in computer science. In fact, when she met Chris Allen in spring 2014 (and, yes, they met on Twitter), she was still very resistant to the idea of learning computer programming. Gradually, he persuaded her to learn Haskell, so at age 40 and with no prior programming experience, she started learning, somewhat unenthusiastically at first. Over time she realized that Haskell's pure functional style has some very pleasing overlaps with some of her previous work in formal logic and abstract syntax and started to develop an interest. She was frustrated by many of the materials available for beginners in Haskell, though, because they assumed extensive computer background that she didn't have. She started helping Chris write his book and finally decided to learn Haskell and coauthor the Haskell book essentially at the same time.

Julie is also a wife, a mother of two handsome young boys, a homeschooler, and something of a dork.
